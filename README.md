## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to create a dashboard that would help Kate visualize the bike-sharing data in NYC.  The dashboard was created in Tableau workbook.  The data was taken and loaded into Pandas to create a DataFrame to help Kate be able to visualize the data better.  The purpose of the analysis was to highlight the length of time that bikes were checked out and by gender, the number of riders by gender by week and the number of riders by weekday.

## Results

After finishing the analysis there were slides prepared to better understand the data.

1.	The first slide shows the duration of the bikes being checked out by all riders.  By looking at results, you can see that the majority of bikes being checked out were in the first 5mins.  By about 20mins, the majority of the bikes were checked back in.

## Summary

After analyzing the data, we can see that the majority of the riders are using the bike-sharing service in the morning commute hours and the evening commute hours.  We can also see that the majority of the riders are male.  Another thing which was seen was that there were more subscribers than nonsubscribers because they were using the service more frequently.
